# ngsreads2microsats
Design microsats from NGS reads. 
The pipeline is decribed in [ngs2microsat.md](ngs2microsat.md)


## Summary

This repository present a method to design microsatellites primers from any species using raw NGS reads even at low coverage. It is centered aroundMSATCOMMANDER[]().

It works in 3 steps:

1. Assembly
2. [MSATCOMMANDER](add link!)
3. Selection of unique and non-overlapping microsatellites
